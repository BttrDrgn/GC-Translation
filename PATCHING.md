# How To Patch An ISO
## NKit.ISOs
Nkit.ISOs may not work well with patching, and most certainly will not work well with compiling the actual project.

To patch an ISO, please download the `Nkit + GameCube Partitions` archive from [Vimm's Lair](https://vimm.net/vault/?p=nkit) and drag and drop your `.nkit.iso` on to the `ConvertToISO.exe`
When finished, an `.iso` file will be in the `Processing/GameCube/` directory of your Nkit folder.

## Patching
If you are not a programmer or don't want to set up the development environment to patch an ISO, a release will be supplied [here](https://github.com/BttrDrgn/GCN-Translations/releases).

- Download the game of the release you want and unpack the `.zip` into its own folder
- Place a non-nkit iso named properly as per the [Supported Games](https://github.com/BttrDrgn/GCN-Translations#supported-games) list on the README into the new folder you just created
  - ex: `Giftpia [J].iso`
- Run the script of the operating system you are on
  - If on Windows just double click the Windows bat
- Your new ISO should be in the root of the folder when finished
