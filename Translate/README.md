GC Japanese To English Translation
===================================
<br />
Translation by krom (Peter Lemon).<br />
<br />
All code compiles out of box with the bass assembler by byuu.<br />
I use a special version of bass by ARM9:<br />
https://github.com/ARM9/bass<br />
I have also included a xdelta 3 file of the translation as a patch.<br />
<br />
Please check out RomHacking & their forum, a great resource for translation work:<br />

<br />
Howto Compile:<br />
You will need the original Japanese disk image in .iso (Big-Endian) Format, in the root directory of the patch.<br />
All the code compiles into a new ISO image (ISONAME.iso) file.<br />
Using bass Run: make.bat<br />
Or you can patch the original Japanese disk image using the xdelta 3 file.<br />
<br />
Howto Run:<br />
I only test with a real GameCube.<br />
<br />
You can also use GameCube emulators like Dolphin.
