Original project and translations by krom (Peter Lemon).

# How To Compile
- Drop your Japanese isos (non-nkit compressed) into the `isos` folder
  - Make sure they are named properly! Check below in the [Supported Games section](https://github.com/BttrDrgn/GCN-Translations/blob/master/README.md#Suppoorted%20Games) for more info
- Download the latest bass release from here https://github.com/ARM9/bass/releases/
- Extract the bass release archive into the `bass` folder on the root of the project
- Run the `.bat` of the game you wish to compile at the root of the project
- The output should be in `output` when finished and will be named `{folder name} [U].iso`
