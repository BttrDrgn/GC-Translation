GameCube Japanese To English Translation Projects
=================================================

Original project and translations by krom (Peter Lemon).

# How To Compile
- Drop your Japanese isos (non-nkit compressed) into the `isos` folder
  - Make sure they are named `{folder name} [J].iso`
  - ex: HomeLand would be `HomeLand [J].iso`
- Download the latest bass release from here https://github.com/ARM9/bass/releases/
- Extract the bass release archive into the `bass` folder on the root of the project
- Run the `.bat` of the game you wish to compile at the root of the project
- The output should be in `output` when finished and will be named `{folder name} [U].iso`
